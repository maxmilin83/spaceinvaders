In this project, I will apply everything I learnt in python so far.

Space shooter game.
You start with 5 lives
You have a ship, which you can move from left to right.
And you can shoot out of it.

The aliens will come in waves, if they get to the bottom of the screen
you lose a life. If you reach 0 lives, you lose the game.

Each wave lasts like 20 or 30 seconds. And each wave the aliens come faster 
and they have more health. You can upgrade your gun to do more damage.
